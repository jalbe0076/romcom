# [RomCom](https://jalbe0076.github.io/romcom-m1-pair/)  

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
A website allowing users to save custom book titles was created. The user has the option to input thier desired image, title, and descriptors or to use a radomized cover pulling data from the data list. Comming up with a custom cover can be challenging. This website helps users come up with their own custom titles by providing the user with ideas when the covers are randomized. The user can then gather their prefered tags and images and make thier own custom cover.

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)

We were assigned the project on 3/28/23 and had until 4/2/23 to work on the project. It was completed on 4/1/23. One partner is currently repeating Mod1 and the other partner is just starting Mod1 and we were assigned the project in the second week of the current inning.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)

There were numerous learning goals in this project, both technical and non-technical.We worked with VS Code, GitHub, Javascript, CSS and HTML.  The technical work goals involved JavaScript competency as far as functional programming concepts, DOM manipulation and readability. There was a lot of learning involved with updating the data model and DOM. We learned out to utilize global and local variables, and when to utilize them. When refactoring we added helper functions that made the code more readable, which was a great learning moment. We strove to have a good Git Workflow going, never merging broken or dead code to main and creating new branches as necessary. The non-technical aspects were collaboration and professionalism.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
Win #1 was learing how to use `event.target.parentNode.id` to select an HTML element
Win #2 learning how to debug more efficiently with console logging text when performing a click action
Win #3 refactoring to use DRY code so that we don't repeat the same code for hiding and showing the webpages - realizing we can use functions to perform this and putting it into action
